# Snowball Challenge
Snowball Challenges unlock achievements , pages of the Great Book, and tools for future Snowball Challenges
There were 8 total challenges on the map to complete.

####Problem : 
They are time consuming, complicated, and a pain.

####Solution:
Complete the 1st and easiest snowball challenge and then use that format and BURp to intercept traffic and 'win' every single challenge after that.


1. Use Burp to proxy traffic
2. Replay traffic
3. change flags
4. use to complete all snowball challenges

I later found out this wasnt the intended way to attack the challenges but it was valid and worked so...

Intercepting using a proxy like burp, allowed you to see the parameters and flags that could be changed without having to actually win the game.
