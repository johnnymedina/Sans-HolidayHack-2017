# Sans-HolidayHack-2017
Every year SANS introduces a new Holiday Hack Challenge that is free to participate in and usually includes relevant security vulnerabilities for the year. The 2017 year had roughly 9,000 participants in the Capture the Flag(CTF) and around 170 challeneges to complete. This is my repository write up of how I completed each challenge in 2017.

## Scope:
1. Authorized to only attack external system called Letters to Santa at l2s.northpolechristmastown.com
2. Authorized to attack systems internal to 10.142.0.0/24 network that could be access through system above 

## Things to Unlock and Collect Along the Way:
1.Command Line Terminal Challenges provide Snowball Tools, Hints, and Achievements
2.Snowball Challenges provide Achievements and pages to the Great Book
3.CTF Objectives also provide Great Book Pages

## Tools Needed:
1.A testing system of your choice (most likely kali)
2.A cloud server not behind a firewall
3.Variety of penetration testing tools (Burp, nmap, proxychians, smblient, netcat, etc)
4.Time to work on challenges during the busiest holidays of the year 

## Objectives:
1) Visit the North Pole and Beyond at the Winter Wonder Landing Level to collect the first page of The Great Book using a giant snowball. 
Submit Flag:
What is the title of that page?

2) Investigate the Letters to Santa application at https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com. 
What is the topic of The Great Book page available in the web root of the server
What is Alabaster Snowball's password?

3) The North Pole engineering team uses a Windows SMB server for sharing documentation and correspondence. 
Using your access to the Letters to Santa server, identify and enumerate the SMB file-sharing server. 
Submit Flag:
What is the file server share name?

4) Elf Web Access (EWA) is the preferred mailer for North Pole elves, available internally at http://mail.northpolechristmastown.com. 
Submit Flag:
What can you learn from The Great Book page found in an e-mail on that server?

5) How many infractions are required to be marked as naughty on Santa's Naughty and Nice List? 
What are the names of at least six insider threat moles? 
Who is throwing the snowballs from the top of the North Pole Mountain and what is your proof?

6) The North Pole engineering team has introduced an Elf as a Service (EaaS) platform to optimize resource allocation for mission-critical Christmas engineering projects at http://eaas.northpolechristmastown.com. 
Visit the system and retrieve instructions for accessing The Great Book page from C:\greatbook.txt. Then retrieve The Great Book PDF file by following those directions. 
Submit Flag:
What is the title of The Great Book page?

7) Like any other complex SCADA systems, the North Pole uses Elf-Machine Interfaces (EMI) to monitor and control critical infrastructure assets. These systems serve many uses, including email access and web browsing. 
Gain access to the EMI server through the use of a phishing attack with your access to the EWA server. 
Retrieve The Great Book page from C:\GreatBookPage7.pdf. 
Submit Flag:
What does The Great Book page describe?

8) Fetch the letter to Santa from the North Pole Elf Database at http://edb.northpolechristmastown.com. 
Submit Flag:
Who wrote the letter?

9) Which character is ultimately the villain causing the giant snowball problem. 
Submit Flag:
What is the villain's motive?
